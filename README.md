# My new portfolio

## Work in progress - far from finished!
I have decided to completely rebuild my portfolio (the old version of which you can view at www.mdlewis.co.uk)
from the ground up using React, Sass and Webpack. I have also decided not to use Bootstrap this time, now that
I have a much better grasp of styling and responsive design.

Run ```npm install``` to install dependencies.
Run ```npm start``` to start webpack dev server, or ```npm run build``` to create production build.
